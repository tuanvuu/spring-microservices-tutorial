# Disable accessing services using service name (i.e. gallery-service).
# They should be only accessed through the path defined below.

#====================================
# By default, all requests to gallery service for example will start with: "/gallery/"

# What will be sent to the gallery service is what comes after the path defined,

# So, if request is "/gallery/view/1", gallery service will get "/view/1".

# In case of auth, we need to pass the "/auth/" in the path to auth service. So, set strip-prefix to false
